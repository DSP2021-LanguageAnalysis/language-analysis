### Description
This app allows for the exploration of a corpus of historical letters using data science methods. The app has two sections. The first is the part of speech, or POS tag, visualisation section. Here there are two tabs, containing bar and line graphs, to give the user a general overview of the dataset. This section contains various options to filter and restrict the dataset to allow the user more freedom in their exploration. The second part of the app is the topic model section. This allows the user to generate, using the latent dirichlet allocation algorithm, a chosen number of “topics” from the data set. When properly filtered and parameterized, this allows the user to see which topics dominated the discussion in the letters. The app gives a wide array of options, so that the user can adjust based on their own questions of interest. 

### Newest online version
Go to http://193.166.25.206:8050/app/postags

### Installation / How to get the app working locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Add data folder `TCEECE` to local project root, this is ignored by GIT to avoid spreading the data (see `.gitignore` file)
6. Start app with `python index.py`
7. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8050/app/postags` or `http://127.0.0.1:8050/app/topicmodel` in your browser

## Usage
### POS Visualisation
#### Scatter:
- Scatterplot with wordcount of each letter on corpus
  -	Each dot represents one letter
  -	y-axis shows how many words that letter have
  -	x-axis year the letter was written
#### Bar:
- Compare male and female tags
  -	X-axis: year of letter with both female and male writers if any
  -	Y-axis: percentage of the POS-tag(s) chosen
- Dynamically grouping years
  - **values incorrect**
  -	X-axis: YearGroup based of chosen number of groups
  -	Y-axis: percentage of NN1-tagged words
- Compare selected attributes
  - **values incorrect**
  -	Select number of year groups
  -	Select an attribute (SenderSex or SenderRank)
  -	X-axis: year groups
  -	Y-axis: percentage of NN1-tags
#### Line:
- Percentage of POS
  -	X-axis: time in years
  -	Y-axis: Percentage of chosen tag(s)
- Groups and compare
  -	Build two groups of tags and compare
  -	X-axis: Percentage of chosen groups of tags

### Topic model
#### BASIC PARAMETERS
#### Number of Topics
- Number of topics to be generated by the LDA model.
#### Number of Iterations
- Maximum number of iterations through the corpus when inferring the topic distribution. 

#### ADVANCED PARAMETERS
#### Alpha
- Parameter which determines the prior distribution over topic weights in documents.
- Auto option: Learns an asymmetric prior from the corpus
#### Eta
- Parameter which determines the prior distribution over word weights in each topic.
- Auto option: Learns an asymmetric prior from the corpus
#### Set Seed
- Option to choose a starting point for the generation of pseudorandom numbers to be used in the algorithm.

#### FILTRATION 
#### POS tag
- Option to instruct the algorithm to only consider words of the chosen word type.
#### Stopwords
- Option to instruct the algorithm to ignore words given in the list.
#### Sex
- Option to instruct the algorithm to only consider letters of individuals from the chosen sex. 
#### Rank
- Option to instruct the algorithm to only consider letters of individuals from the chosen rank.
#### Relationship
- Option to instruct the algorithm to only consider letters between senders and receivers of a chosen relationship status.
#### Time range
- Option to instruct the algorithm to only consider letters sent between the chosen years. 


## Theory
### POS Visualisation
#### Scatter:
•	Word count of each letter
#### Bar:
•	Word count / time / senderSex
•	Year grouped
•	Selected attribute
#### Line:
•	Percentage of POS
•	Groups and compare

### Topic model
